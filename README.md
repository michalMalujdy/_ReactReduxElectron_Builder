# Builder

## Overview
The purpose of the project was to easily and quickly build work projects which had different technologies and steps. The application had to be a desktop app in order to interact with the OS shell so that it can execute each building step. Because of that, the electron library was chosen.

<b>This repository does not contain any sensitive work-related data. Real project names and steps were substituted.</b>
